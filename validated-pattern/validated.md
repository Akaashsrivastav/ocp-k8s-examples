## Validated Patterns
    Validated Patterns are an evolution of how you deploy applications in a hybrid cloud. With a pattern, you can automatically deploy a full application stack through a GitOps-based framework. With this framework, you can create business-centric solutions while maintaining a level of Continuous Integration (CI) over your application.

## Steps to Create a Validated Pattern
**1. Identify the Need:**
    A common problem in software development is managing complex object creation. The need is for a solution that simplifies and standardizes this process.
**2. Design the Pattern:**
    Based on the problem, design the "Builder" pattern, which separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
**3. Implement the Pattern:**
    Implement the Builder pattern in a sample project to demonstrate its use.
**4. Test the Pattern:**
    Test the Builder pattern with various objects and scenarios to ensure it simplifies object creation and works correctly.
**5. Iterate and Refine:**
    Gather feedback from developers using the pattern, make improvements, and retest.
**6. Document the Pattern:**
    Create documentation that explains the Builder pattern, including code examples, use cases, and implementation steps.
**7. Validate the Pattern:**
    Get validation from senior developers and architects through code reviews and pilot projects.
**8. Standardize and Share:**
    Standardize the use of the Builder pattern in the organization's development guidelines and provide training to the development team.
